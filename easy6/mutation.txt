We start by assigning array1 to an array and array2 to an
empty array. Then, for each element in the array, we use the <<
operator to append it to array2. As a result array1[0] and
array2[0] reference the same object, and likewise for the other
indices. Then we apply String#upcase! to each element of arr1 which
starts with 'C' or 'S'. It mutates these objects, and so when we
print array2, we see each of these elements in all caps.
